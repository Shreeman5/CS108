CS108/Computer Science For All/Netlogo

All of the projects listed are done in Netlogo. These projects were done in my 
first semester at UNM. These projects were my first foray into Computer Science.
Before January 2018, I had never done any form of CS in my life but because of 
this class, I enjoyed CS and eventually determined that this is what I want to do
for the rest of my life.
